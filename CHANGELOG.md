- [theia-frontend] Cleanup diagram widget initialization by removing no longer needed options [#123](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-theia-integration/pull/60)
- [theia-frontend] Fixed a bug that prevented activation of the diagram widget on model source changes [#168](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-theia-integration/pull/61)
- [theia-frontend] Fixed a bug that kept the hover feedback visible after the diagram widget becomes inactive [#184](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-theia-integration/pull/64)
- [theia-frontend] Made rebind of `CommandPalette` to `TheiaCommandPalette` optional to ensure compatibility with DI configurations where no `CommandPalette` is bound [#188](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-theia-integration/pull/65)
- [theia-frontend] Adapted `SetDirtyStateAction` to provide an optional `reason` property indicating the cause for the dirty state change  [#197](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-theia-integration/pull/67)
- [theia-fronted] Introduced `GLSPSelectionDataService` which can be used to forward additional information on top of the selection to the Theia selection service. [#228](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp/issues/228)

<a name="server_changes_1.9.0">[Server:](#server_changes_1.9.0)</a>

- [websocket] Fixed issue that was caused by reusing a shared injector for each client connection [#149](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/91)
- [server] Added a utility class for 'JsonOpenerOptions' [#153](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/93)
- [websocket] Align package import of javax.servlet with the dependency range of Jetty [#156](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/94)
- [server] Reworked model update flow. All aspects of the update process are now handled by the `ModelSubmissionHandler` [#122](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/95)
- [server] Reworked and split `ModelFactory` API into a dedicated component responsible for loading the model source (`ModelSourceLoader`) and a component responsible for transforming the current modelstate into its GModel-representation (`GModelFactory`)  [#119](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/96)
- [protocol] Updated kind of `SelectAction` to be in-line with the client type. This ensures correct of handling of `SelectAction`s that were sent from the server [#191](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/98)
- [protocol] Added implementation for `SetViewportAction` [#179](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/99)
- [server] Introduced `GArgumentable` interface which is implemented by all `GModelElement`s. This can be used to provide additional information in form of an `args` map without having to extend the `GModel` type [#194](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/100)
- [server] Extended default type mapping and added builder for `GArgumentable` elements and corresponding utility classes [#180](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/105)
- [protocol]  Added `fileUri` property to `SaveModelAction` and updated `SaveModelActionHandler` accordingly [#208](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/103/)
- [protocol] Added optional `reason` string property to `SetDirtyStateAction`. This property indicates the reason that caused to dirty state change and enables more fine granular handling of dirty state changes [#197](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/101)

<a name="breaking_changes_1.9.0">[Breaking Changes:](#breaking_changes_1.9.0)</a>
- [theia-integration] Renamed `GLSPServerContribution.start()` to `GLSPServerContribution.connect()` [#35](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-theia-integration/pull/55)
- [glsp-client & theia-integration] Replaced `ExternalNavigateToTargetHandler` and its implementation in Theia `TheiaNavigateToTargetHandler` with a generic action `NavigateToExternalTargetAction` [#153](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/95) and an action handler `TheiaNavigateToExternalTargetHandler` in Theia [#153](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-theia-integration/pull/57)
- [glsp-server] Merged the `ServerLayoutConfiguration` API into the `DiagramConfiguration` API. The standalone `ServerLayoutConfiguration` is now deprecated and no longer supported [#123](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/95)
- [glsp-server] Renamed `ModelFactory` to `ModelSourceLoader` and adapted interface method. This also affects implementing classes like the `JsonFileModelFactory` [#119](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/96)
- [glsp-server] Reworked `ModelSubmissionHandler` API. This includes changes of method names and parameters [#119](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/96) [#197](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-server/pull/101)
- [theia-integration] Dropped the dependency to the deprecated `@theia/languages` package. This enables  compatibility with new Theia versions (>1.4.0). As a consequence the new minium requirment for `sprotty-theia` is > 0.9.0 [#189](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-theia-integration/pull/66)
- [glsp-client] Introduced `glspViewportModule`. This module contains a custom `ScrollMouseListener` that gets disabled if the `MarqueeTool` is active. This module should be used instead of the `viewportModule` provided by sprotty [#199](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp-client/pull/108)


## [v0.8.0 - 20/10/2020](https://github.com/eclipse-glsp/glsp/releases/tag/0.8.0)

This is the first release of Eclipse GLSP since it is hosted at the Eclipse Foundation. The 0.8.0 release includes new protocol message types and respective framework support for several new features, such as copy-paste, diagram navigation, etc. It also contains several clean-ups of the protocol and refactorings to simplify and streamline the API.
