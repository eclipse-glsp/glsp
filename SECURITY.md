# Security Policy

Eclipse GLSP follows the [Eclipse Vulnerability Reporting Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/security/policy.php). Vulnerabilities are tracked by the Eclipse security team, in cooperation with the GLSP project leads. Fixing vulnerabilities is taken care of by the GLSP project committers, with assistance and guidance of the security team.

## Supported Versions

Eclipse GLSP is still in the incubation phase. During this phase only the most current release is supported
with security updates.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 0.8.0   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 0.8.0 | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We recommend that in case of suspected vulnerabilities you do not use the GLSP public issue tracker, but instead contact the Eclipse Security Team directly via security@eclipse.org.
